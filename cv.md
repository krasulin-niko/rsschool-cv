### **About Myself:**
Colleagues, good day to all!
The idea to start and achieve something in programming, was born quite a long time ago. I studied in Chelyabinsk as an information security engineer. But at that time it was a poorly paid profession. So I switched completely to sales. And I started to get good at it. I worked in the biggest distribution companies in Russia selling computer equipment. Before I knew it, I was selling for 20 years. Unfortunately, it's been a long time since I enjoyed my work. Now there is still time to move to IT. I want programming to be my craft and entertainment at the same time. Good luck to everyone and have a great time. Thanks for the course.
